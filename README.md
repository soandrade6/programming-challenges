This space is dedicated to practicing programming challenges. In this repository you will find my solution implementations for various Codeforces and Hackerrank issues.
 <!--
Additionally, the exercises are categorized based on difficulty levels from Codeforces:
* Easy: Beginner-friendly problems to grasp fundamental concepts.
* Medium: Intermediate-level problems to enhance problem-solving skills.
* Hard: Advanced challenges for those seeking a greater challenge.

## Codeforces difficulty levels
Here is an overview of the difficulty ranges in Codeforces:

* 800-1200: Very easy problems, suitable for beginners.
* 1200-1500: Easy problems, suitable for those who have gained some experience.
* 1500-1800: Problems of medium difficulty, appropriate for intermediate programmers.
* 1800-2100: More challenging problems, aimed at more advanced programmers.
* 2100-2400: Difficult problems, for those with significant experience.
* 2400-2700: Very difficult problems, requiring advanced skills in algorithms and data structures.
* 2700-3000: Extremely difficult problems, reserved for very competent programmers.
* 3000-3500+: Exceptionally difficult problems, suitable for high-level contestants and competitors in the final stages of competitions.
